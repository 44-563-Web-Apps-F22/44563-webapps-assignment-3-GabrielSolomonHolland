<h1>Welcome to Gabriel's Page</h1>


<h3>The Nelson Atkins Museum of Art</h3>
<p>The Nelson Atkins is a great museum in Kansas City, Missouri. Must see exhibits include the Egypt section, which contains a <b>real mummy!</b> 
    There is also the Africa section, which is classified differently than Egypt <i>even though Egypt is in Africa</i>. I mean I guess separating those makes
<b>some</b> sense because of vastly different cultures and time periods but also, really guys? It seems to broadly generalize the cultures of sub-saharah Africa. </p>

    <h3>Tables! Here is a table of places you should visit</h3>

    <p>So just some information here, some cities you should (and shouldn't visit) I picked a few cities from all over the world (midwest USA and Europe) and 
        identified some places you should go check out. I also gave you a little guide on how long you should stay at each place. My real question is that will the ga
        for this class actually read in depth? If the ga or hoot himself actually reads this paragraph you can go ahead and prove it by leaving an extra credit point on
        my assignment and leaving a little comment. Some of my top cities are Kansas City, Barcelona, and Maryville. Don't go to Paris, Paris sucks.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>City</th>
            <th>Important location</th>
            <th>Time you should spend there</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kansas City, KS</td>
            <td>Legends Outlets</td>
            <td>1 Month</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Barcelona</td>
            <td>The cathedral that has been under construction for 200 years</td>
            <td>A week</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Maryville</td>
            <td>The statue of Bobby Bearcat</td>
            <td>An eternity</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Paris</td>
            <td>Nothing interesting, don't go</td>
            <td>Is it possible to spend negative time there?</td>
        </tr>
