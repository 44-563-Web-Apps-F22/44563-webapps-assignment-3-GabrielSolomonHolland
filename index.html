<h3>The Nelson Atkins Museum of Art</h3>
<p>The Nelson Atkins is a great museum in Kansas City, Missouri. Must see exhibits include the Egypt section, which contains a <b>real mummy!</b> 
    There is also the Africa section, which is classified differently than Egypt <i>even though Egypt is in Africa</i>. I mean I guess separating those makes
<b>some</b> sense because of vastly different cultures and time periods but also, really guys? It seems to broadly generalize the cultures of sub-saharah Africa. </p>
